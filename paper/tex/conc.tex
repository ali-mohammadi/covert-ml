\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:conc}
In this paper, we introduced a novel deep learning-based covert communication scheme using adversarial training and generative models. We showed how our covert sender establishes a reliable and an undetectable covert channel by hiding the covert messages into the channel's noise by help of an observer network so that the channel's statistical properties remain intact. We provided information on the performance of covert model on different channel models and noise levels. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of our added covert signals on the performance of the autoencoder-based communication system and verified our covert scheme causes no disturbance on the existing communication between normal users. Our results indicate that our covert models were successfully trained to covertly communicate while having a minimum impact on the normal communication of the system.
