\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:conc}
In this paper, we introduced a novel deep learning-based covert communication scheme using adversarial training and generative models. We showed our method establishes a reliable, undetectable covert channel by hiding the covert messages into the channel's noise. Our results indicate that our covert model does not rely on the channel model and is agnostic to the cover signals. Three channel models of AWGN, Rayleigh, and Rician fading were considered in this work and the performance of our models was evaluated for different covert rates and system users. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of our added covert signals on the performance of the ongoing normal system and demonstrated our covert scheme causes almost no disturbance to the system.
