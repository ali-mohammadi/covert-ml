\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:conc}
In this paper, we have presented a novel deep learning-based covert communication scheme that utilizes adversarial training and generative models. Our approach establishes a reliable and undetectable covert channel by hiding covert messages within the channel's noise. Our results indicate that our covert model is independent of the channel model and is agnostic to the cover signals. We have considered three channel models, namely AWGN, Rayleigh, and Rician fading, and evaluated the performance of our models for different covert rates and number of system users. Moreover, we have investigated the impact of our added covert signals on the performance of the ongoing normal system and demonstrated that our covert scheme causes minimal disturbance to the system.
