\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:conc}
In this paper, we introduced a novel deep learning-based covert communication scheme using adversarial training and generative models. We showed how our covert sender establishes a reliable and an undetectable covert channel by hiding the covert messages into the channel's noise with help of an observer network so that the channel's statistical properties remain intact. We considered both single-user and multi-user communication models and presented our results for each. Our results indicate that our covert model does not rely on the channel model and is agnostic to the cover signals. We also provided information on the performance of the covert model on various noise levels and channel models. Three channel models of AWGN, Rayleigh, and Rician fading were considered in this work and the performance of our models was evaluated for different covert rates and system users. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of our added covert signals on the performance of the ongoing normal communication system and verified that our covert scheme causes almost no disturbance to the existing communication between normal users. According to our results, our covert model is successful in establishing a covert channel with minimal impact on normal communication.
