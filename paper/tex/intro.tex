\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}
Due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, considerable attention has been given to the security and privacy aspects of wireless communications. While the content of messages (i.e., the information transmitted over the channel) can be protected against unauthorized access using cryptography or physical-layer security techniques \cite{zhou2013physical}, there are occasions when hiding the very existence of the communication channel is as vital as securing the communicated messages themselves. Examples of such situations include military operations, cyber espionage, social unrest, or privacy concerns of communication parties. All of the aforementioned have motivated the study of hidden communication channels, which are referred to as ``covert communication'' \cite{lampson1973note} in the literature.

There is a large body of work that focuses on different schemes of covert communication applied to traditional wireless systems. However, wireless systems research has greatly expanded in recent years to consider the potential impact of machine learning (ML) approaches for a variety of problems \cite{wang2017deep}. In fact, various network optimization problems, which were traditionally handled using statistical models, now leverage machine learning techniques. Deep neural networks (DNNs) in particular, the major force in machine learning, have helped address several wireless problems, such as signal classification, channel estimation, transmitter identification, jamming, and anti-jamming \cite{bahramali2021robust}. In a recent study, an end-to-end communication model based on deep learning emerged as a replacement for conventional modular-based designs \cite{o2017introduction}. In this new paradigm, the transmitter and receiver are jointly trained as the encoder and decoder of an autoencoder network [6]. The autoencoder network can be trained to learn the characteristics of the signal, such as its statistical properties, and can then be used to perform compression or denoising on the signal. This improves the efficiency of wireless transmission and helps to reduce the number of errors that occur during transmission. One noticeable difference between end-to-end systems and conventional modular designs is that in end-to-end systems, the encoder and decoder learn the coding and modulation tasks simultaneously, as opposed to having separate modules for each. This gives autoencoder networks an advantage in enhancing the error-correction capability of wireless systems by identifying and rectifying errors that occur during transmission. Despite all these benefits, it has been established that deep learning models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks \cite{bahramali2021robust, chakraborty2018adversarial}. This drives us to study the vulnerabilities that ML-based wireless communication systems might have against covert communications.

The preliminary attempt to obtain covertness started with the study of spread spectrum almost a century ago, with the main purpose of hiding military communications \cite{scholtz1982origins}. The idea was to transmit the signal over a wide frequency band, which would make it harder to locate and identify the original signal amidst the background noise. Many works continued to further examine different aspects of this idea. However, the fundamental performance limits of such work were unknown until recently when Bash et al. \cite{bash2012square} established a square root limit on the number of covert bits that can be reliably sent over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Following this work, there has been a surge of interest in examining covert channels \cite{sobers2017covert,soltani2018covert,sheikholeslami2018multi,cao2018wireless}.

Numerous works have studied the theoretical limits of covert communication over wireless systems in different scenarios \cite{bash2012square, soltani2018covert, sheikholeslami2018multi, li2021fundamental}, but only a few works have focused on the practical implementation of covert communication. Almost all of these works involve an external factor that covert users rely on to build their covert communication, such as hardware impairments \cite{mohammed2021adversarial}, the presence of a cooperative jammer \cite{sobers2017covert}, or the cooperation of a relay node \cite{liao2020generative, kim2022covert}. Additionally, the majority of works make some favorable assumptions for covert users, such as the existence of a shared secret key between Alice and Bob unknown to Willie \cite{soltani2018covert}, the accessibility of covert users to cover signals and modulation type \cite{grzesiak2021wireless}, uncertainty in the knowledge of noise power at Willie's receiver \cite{he2017covert}, neglecting the impact of the covert system on normal communication \cite{mohammed2021adversarial}, and limiting the channel model to AWGN \cite{mohammed2021adversarial}. Imposing such restricted assumptions and dependencies eliminates the generality of these covert models and makes it difficult for them to adapt to different system deployments with distinct conditions. Last but certainly not least, recent studies show that covert communication that causes noticeable divergence in the statistical properties of signals can be easily detected using analytical and steganalysis methods \cite{bahramali2021robust,huang2020exploiting}.

In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning-based covert communication method that is free of many aforementioned assumptions. It merely relies on the existing channel's noise effect and is independent of any external factor. Our scheme also requires no knowledge of the cover signals, the modulation type, or even the channel type in single-user systems. We have optimized our solution to have the minimum impact on the normal communication while being stealth to a watchful system observer. More importantly, by training our covert models in an adversarial setting against the observer, we ensure that our added covert signals do not cause any conspicuous deviation in the statistical properties of the signals. This prevents our covert signals from being easily detected using analytical tools. It is also worthwhile to mention that even though we are proposing our method for autoencoder-based wireless communication systems, there is no limitation on integrating our model into existing conventional wireless communication systems.

The contributions of this work can be expressed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Cover-Agnostic}: We propose a novel covert communication method that uses GANs and is independent of cover signals, waveforms, and modulation types of wireless systems.
	\item \textbf{Channel Independent}: In our proposed covert scheme, we train our model on three different channel models: AWGN, Rayleigh Fading, and Rician Fading. We show that our model does not rely on any information about the channel model or the noise level.
	\item \textbf{Single-/Multi-User Adaptability}: We demonstrate that our work can be integrated into both single-user and multi-user communication setups, and it is robust to channel interference. We also show that there is a degree-of-freedom effect in our scheme, where increasing the number of users affects the performance of the covert and normal communication systems in the fading channels.
	\item \textbf{Undetectability}: By forming an adversarial competition between the observer and covert users, wherein one competes to outperform the other, we find an optimal solution that ensures the observer of the system will perform almost no better than random guessing in differentiating the covert and non-covert transmissions.
	\item \textbf{Low Interference}: We show our covert scheme causes minimal disruption to the ongoing normal communication system, as evidenced by our evaluation of the normal communication BLER after implementing our covert model.
