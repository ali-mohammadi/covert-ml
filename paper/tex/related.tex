Present a brief overview of the works that are most related to your paper. Organize them in categories.

\cat{Category 1}
Works in this category assume that precise demand information is known in advance. A few representative works in this category are as follows. In~\cite{shi14}, it is assumed that all users require a fixed transmission rate, which is known by the system. Thus, their focus is on controlling the queues at the base station, where user data packets are buffered for transmission. In practice, it is infeasible to know precise user demands in advance, which limits the practicality of such schemes.
