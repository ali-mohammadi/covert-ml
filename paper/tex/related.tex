The main idea of our work stems from the stenography techniques, which are commonly used in image steganography. Hence, we first briefly go over the history and the current state of this field of research and then we continue reviewing some of the existing approaches of establishing covert communication at the physical layer in a wireless network.


\textbf{Image Steganography}: Deep learning algorithms have proved their efficiency in many aspects. Steganography is one of these areas that has benefited tremendously from deep learning advancements in recent years. The earliest use cases were in steganalysis research. Convolution neural networks (CNNs) for instance, which are generally used in computer vision tasks, showed outstanding results in image steganalysis \cite{tan2014stacked,qian2015deep,xu2016structural}, replacing the traditional statistical methods. One of the earliest works of image steganography using deep neural networks is a work by \cite{baluja2017hiding}. In this work, Baluja proposes a hiding scheme in which the three networks of preparation, hiding, and reveal sort out the secret encoding and decoding task. The preparation network transforms the hidden message into features that are commonly used for compressing images. Then, the hiding network embeds it into the cover image and sends it to the reveal network, where the secret message gets extracted from the container image. Following this work, it was discovered that the existence of preparation network is not necessary and the framework can be expressed in a simpler form by excluding this network \cite{zhang2021brief}. The disadvantage of these schemes is that the encoding process is reliant on the cover image. To address this, Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2020udh} propose a new architecture in which secret message can be encoded independent of the cover image. Beside having more flexibility on hiding the information, this approach has also become an effective method for image watermarking. To manifest robustness against steganalysis practices, researchers started to adopt generative adversarial network (GAN) architectures. A typical adversarial network consists of two neural networks, a generator network (G) and a discriminator network (D). These two networks are then trained against each other where the generator tries to deceive the discriminator by generating data similar to those of in the training set and the discriminator tries to correctly categorize them as fake and real \cite{goodfellow2014generative}. Volkhonskiy et al. \cite{volkhonskiy2020steganographic} propose a steganography technique based on GAN networks. The main idea of their work is to use a generative network to produce a new set of cover images that when carries the secret message using any of the available steganography techniques will be less exposed to be detected by a discriminator network (i.e. a steganalysis network). Similarly, Hayes et al. \cite{hayes2017generating} introduce a GAN-based steganography technique with a different objective for the generator network. Instead of generating cover images, the generator learns to embed secret messages into the cover images so that the discriminator cannot distinguish cover images from stenographic images. Although this adversarial scenario was preliminary introduced for hiding data in images, researchers found it so versatile that it has been applied into the other forms of data such as video, audio and recently wireless signals.


\textbf{Covert Communication}: One of the first attempts to implement a real-world covert communication is the work by Dutta et al. \cite{dutta2012secret}. They leverage the communication noise caused by either the channel or the hardware imperfections to establish a covert channel. In their proposed method, messages are covertly encoded in the constellation error of the normal cover signals. Similarly, Cao et al. \cite{cao2018wireless} further improve this method with the goal of reducing probability of detection. Hou et al. \cite{hou2020cloaklora} propose an amplitude based covert channel over LoRa PHY. In their scheme, covert information is embedded with a modulation scheme orthogonal to chirp spread spectrum (CSS). Bonati et al. \cite{bonati2021stealte} introduce SteaLTE which is a full-stack wireless steganography method on softwarized cellular networks. To covertly modulate symbols, they employ three different approaches of dirty QPSK modulation, hierarchical amplitude shift keying (ASK) manipulation, and phase offset of the primary symbols modification. The disadvantage of all the above methods is that the distortions caused in the statistical properties of the system can be detected with high confidence by a careful observer. More recent works have explored the viability of deep neural networks in covert communication problem. Sankhe et al. \cite{sankhe2019impairment} propose a method called Impairment Shift Keying that produces subtle variations in normal signals in a controlled way such that a CNN model can be trained to classify them as zeros or ones. To achieve the highest covert rate while minimizing the probability of detection, Liao et al. \cite{liao2020generative} employ a GAN model that can adaptively adjust the signal power at the covert sender. Motivated by the GAN-based steganography technique, Mohammed et al. \cite{mohammed2021adversarial} formulate the covert communication as a three-player game in which three networks compete against each other. In this setup, the encoder and decoder networks learn to covertly communicate through a form of noise and simultaneously try to confuse a detector network that tries to differentiate expected noise of the system from the covert added perturbations.


While our proposed method shares the same idea as of aforementioned work, there are a couple of deficiencies that our work aims to address. First, our model is not leveraging on any hardware impairment noise and embeds the covert signals into the existing channel's noise. Second, our covert model is completely independent of the cover signal whereas covert users of previous work are dependent on the knowledge of cover signals. Third, in the previous work, the impact of added covert signals on communication is unknown, whereas our model is optimized to preserve the performance of normal communication. And finally, previous work assumes the channel between users to be AWGN for simplification, however, in a real wireless communication system there is also fading and the AWGN is not an accurate model for simulating the channel effects. Our work addresses this by considering two other channel models of Rayleigh and Rician fading.
